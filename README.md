# hello-world

I write songs. I'm learning to code.
I'm a barista with a BFA (Visual Art), and I'm training to teach yoga. 
  I'm going to teach yoga to programmers. 
    This will make my students and I "Yogrammers". 
      Yes, coffee will be served before, after, and sometimes during Javasana. ;)
